# Javascript Chess

This repository contains a chess game built using JavaScript. The game allows users to play against each other or against an AI opponent.

## Getting Started

To play the game, simply clone or download the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Features

- The game includes a traditional chess board and pieces.
- Users can choose to play against each other or against an AI opponent.
- The AI uses a minimax algorithm to make its moves, providing a challenging opponent.
- The game includes a move history and the ability to undo moves.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to add additional features to the game such as:

- The ability to save and load games.
- The ability to play against other players online.
- Improved AI with more advanced strategies.
